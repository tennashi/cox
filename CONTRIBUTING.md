# Contributing

## Commands

- `cargo xtask setup` installs the pinned development tools.
- `cargo xtask ci` runs every check. A change is ready only when it passes.

## Pull requests

Pull requests are merged with a merge commit, so every commit lands on
`main` as written and must pass `cargo xtask ci` on its own.

## Commit messages

Commit messages follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
A change confined to one crate uses the crate name as the scope, dropping a
leading `cox-`, as in `feat(core): ...` for `cox-core`. Other changes have no
scope.
